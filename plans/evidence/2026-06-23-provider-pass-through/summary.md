Generated: 2026-06-24T07:58:19.302Z

## Commands

- Baseline command for this evidence: `node scripts/provider-pass-through.mjs --all`
- Native provider calls use direct HTTP requests.
- ColdSearch calls use `node dist/cli.js <path> --providers <provider> --single-provider --json`.
- Agent mode is not executed by this gate.

## Evidence Files

- `results.jsonl`: one machine-readable row per required provider/path.
- `samples/`: redacted native and ColdSearch samples for rows that ran.
- `coldsearch-usage.jsonl`: usage log emitted by the ColdSearch calls.

Missing credentials or endpoints are recorded as `blocked_missing_secret`, not skipped or passed.
